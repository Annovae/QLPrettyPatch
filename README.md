QLPrettyPatch
=============

QLPrettyPatch is a QuickLook generator for patch files.

Once installed, you can select patch file attachments in an email or patch files in Finder, hit `spacebar` and get a colorized/prettified representation of the patch.

From the Terminal, you can also run `qlmanage -p /path/to/my.patch` to open the patch in a QuickLook preview pane.
